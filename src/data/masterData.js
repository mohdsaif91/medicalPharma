Lamivudine (Epivir-HBV) is used to treat hepatitis B infection. Lamivudine is in a class of medications called nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). It works by decreasing the amount of HIV and hepatitis B in the blood. Although lamivudine does not cure HIV, it may decrease your chance of developing acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and HIV-related illnesses such as serious infections or cancer. Taking these medications along with practicing safer sex and making other lifestyle changes may decrease the risk of transmitting (spreading) the HIV or hepatitis B virus to other people.",

When your supply of lamivudine starts to run low, get more from your doctor or pharmacist. If you miss doses or stop taking lamivudine, your condition may become more difficult to treat.",

    additionalDetials:
      "Look at the skin that you plan to cover with a lidocaine patch. If the skin is broken or blistered, do not apply a patch to that area. Use scissors to remove the outer seal from the package. Then pull apart the zipper seal.Remove up to three patches from the package and press the zipper seal tightly together. The remaining patches may dry out if the zipper seal is not tightly closed.  Cut patch(es) to the size and shape that will cover your most painful area. Peel the transparent liner off the back of the patch(es). Press the patch(es) firmly onto your skin. If you are applying a patch to your face, be careful not to let it touch your eyes. If you do get lidocaine in your eye, wash it with plenty of water or saline solution. Wash your hands after handling lidocaine patches. Do not reuse lidocaine patches. After you are finished using a patch, remove it and dispose of it out of reach of children and pets. Used patches contain enough medication to seriously harm a child or pet.",

If your symptoms do not improve or if they get worse, call your doctor.Use ertapenem injection until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop using ertapenem injection too soon or if you skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics.Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.",
